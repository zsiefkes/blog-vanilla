home stretch!

current tasks:
- navbar flexbox
- center shit in the page.
- apply a media query somewhere to make the posts full width.
- delete those code comments! tidy up. and then you are done son!
- make the buttons bigger please

steps to achieve this:

achieved:
- see if we can do password authentication!
- be able to log in users!
- add logout button
- be able to log users in and out! create and destroy sessions.
- associate posts with a user
    - add a user_id column to the posts table in database
    - have user_id be stored in the session and accessible
    - pass it along with the form data
    - read it in the server and add it to the sql insertion
    - now grab the user_id as well when you read the posts and user that to um cross reference with the users table to be able to um say who posted the thing! using their username. and have the username hyperlink to a profile page :o )
- create a user profile page for each user displaying all their posts
- add delete post button 
    - if the post is yours,
    - you have a delete button that sends a um. i guess post request to post/destroy.php
    - then you're redirected... i dunno, somewhere. probably wherever you just came from?
    - can send that along as a parameter to the post route
    - and have a default redirect to the dashboard one if none is sent. :)
- update post. from read post page.
- change all instances of "/blog1/" in the url to "../" please.
- get CRUD going for users and posts.
    - Create post - done
    - Read post - done
    - Update post - done
    - Delete post - done

    - Create user - done
    - Read user - done
    - Update user - done
    - Delete user - done
- now just include mysql commands to initialize tables in submission!!!

up ahead:
- be able to "deactivate" your account. make use of checking a user is enabled

future goal:
- can we generalise the navbar to reduce code um repitition?

nice to haves:
- beside timestamp or instead of timestamp, put in eg. "one hour ago, 2 days ago"

other tasks:
- oh: profile should be um. user/read, shouldn't it? and same as with post/read, it should hopefully have an edit button that replaces some of the elements with a form that posts to user/update
- okay cool, can do...
- style the navbar!
- do we wanna be able to comment too? maybe get the rest of the things working first, come to that later if you have time.
- want to be able to edit your user details if you are the logged in user on your own profile page.
- implement js error handling on forms
- i'd like to spend some time doing a responsive css layout
- gives posts a title?
