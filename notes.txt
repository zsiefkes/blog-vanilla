current task:
customize profile page for the person who's viewing their own page

- get CRUD going for users and posts.
    - Create post - done
    - Read post
    - Update post
    - Delete post

    - Create user - done
    - Read user - done
    - Update user
    - Delete user

steps to achieve this:

achieved:
- see if we can do password authentication!
- be able to log in users!
- add logout button
- be able to log users in and out! create and destroy sessions.
- associate posts with a user
    - add a user_id column to the posts table in database
    - have user_id be stored in the session and accessible
    - pass it along with the form data
    - read it in the server and add it to the sql insertion
    - now grab the user_id as well when you read the posts and user that to um cross reference with the users table to be able to um say who posted the thing! using their username. and have the username hyperlink to a profile page :o )
- create a user profile page for each user displaying all their posts

up ahead:
- be able to "deactivate" your account. make use of checking a user is enabled

future goal:

nice to haves:
- beside timestamp or instead of timestamp, put in eg. "one hour ago, 2 days ago"

other tasks:
- style the navbar!
- do we wanna be able to comment too? maybe get the rest of the things working first, come to that later if you have time.
- want to be able to delete a post if it's your post.
- want to be able to edit your user details if you are the logged in user on your own profile page.
- implement js error handling on forms
- also want to add error checking to the forms, use javascript for this??????? 
- i think the most important thing to do at this point is to get an MVP going. you need to do a little more layout css shit. please. just copy twitter
- i'd like to spend some time doing a responsive css layout
