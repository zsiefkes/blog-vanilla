current task:
- update post. from read post page.

- need to fix the view post button. ideally make it the whole thing, if you can't get that to work just use a view post link beside delete post maybe. for now.
- i was thinking maybe add some css to the dashboard / post list that um. enlarges each post on hover? quite quickly. could be nice
- read post page. click on i dunno view post or some shit to view just that post
- after we get the rest of the shit done we can do comments, yeah? comments are good.....

- get CRUD going for users and posts.
    - Create post - done
    - Read post - done
    - Update post
    - Delete post - done

    - Create user - done
    - Read user - done
    - Update user
    - Delete user
        - yikes, to delete a user you need to first remove all of their posts
        - once we have comments too, you need to delete all their comments too.
        - or, maybe just leave the things. bleugh

steps to achieve this:

achieved:
- see if we can do password authentication!
- be able to log in users!
- add logout button
- be able to log users in and out! create and destroy sessions.
- associate posts with a user
    - add a user_id column to the posts table in database
    - have user_id be stored in the session and accessible
    - pass it along with the form data
    - read it in the server and add it to the sql insertion
    - now grab the user_id as well when you read the posts and user that to um cross reference with the users table to be able to um say who posted the thing! using their username. and have the username hyperlink to a profile page :o )
- create a user profile page for each user displaying all their posts
- add delete post button 
    - if the post is yours,
    - you have a delete button that sends a um. i guess post request to post/destroy.php
    - then you're redirected... i dunno, somewhere. probably wherever you just came from?
    - can send that along as a parameter to the post route
    - and have a default redirect to the dashboard one if none is sent. :)

up ahead:
- be able to "deactivate" your account. make use of checking a user is enabled

future goal:
- can we generalise the navbar to reduce code um repitition?

nice to haves:
- beside timestamp or instead of timestamp, put in eg. "one hour ago, 2 days ago"

other tasks:
- change all instances of "/blog1/" in the url to "../" please.
- oh: profile should be um. user/read, shouldn't it? and same as with post/read, it should hopefully have an edit button that replaces some of the elements with a form that posts to user/update
- okay cool, can do...
- style the navbar!
- do we wanna be able to comment too? maybe get the rest of the things working first, come to that later if you have time.
- want to be able to edit your user details if you are the logged in user on your own profile page.
- implement js error handling on forms
- i'd like to spend some time doing a responsive css layout
- gives posts a title?
